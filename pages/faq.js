                regular events being workshops, research talks, movie nights,
                and the MAIS 202 bootcamp. We’ll be working to hold more

                Can I still come to your events even if I have no experience

            <p>
                Absolutely. We are a student club that strives to learn more
                about AI by building a community with similar goals - if
                anything, we’re also learning ourselves. For more about AI

                If you are new to programming, we would highly recommend that
                you build a solid understanding of Python fundamentals first.

            <p>
                We are a group of students who are still learning about AI and

                non-sponsors for networking events, research opportunities on
                campus (pertaining to AI), and the AI4Good summer lab.
